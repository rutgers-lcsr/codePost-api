"""Split one master dataset file into a per-student variant pool.

Chunks are disjoint (every row goes to exactly one chunk) and sized by rows-per-chunk
rather than current enrollment, so the pool stays stable as students enroll or drop —
core.services.dataset_assignment.get_or_assign() balances students across whatever pool
exists, doubling up on a chunk only if enrollment ever exceeds the chunk count.
